It is common for images of a countryâ€™s previous leaders, or other individuals of historical significance, to appear on its money. The individuals that appear on banknotes
in the United States are listed.
Write a program that begins by reading the denomination of a banknote from the
user. Then your program should display the name of the individual that appears on the banknote of the entered amount. An appropriate error message should be displayed
if no such note exists.
Individual Amount
George Washington $1
Thomas Jefferson $2
Abraham Lincoln $5
Alexander Hamilton $10
